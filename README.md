# ScratchyISS
Experimental code exploring ScratchX ISS Tracker extension.

Note that it is not possible to open a project with experimental extensions from the ScratchX site in Scratch 2.0 or the offline editor because the extensions are by the community, so they are not allowed on the main site. Alternatively, one can download the .sbx file and send it to others, and they can open it on ScratchX.
